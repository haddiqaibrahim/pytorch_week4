# PyTorch Week 4 – Deep Learning Practice

This repository includes my work and learning progress from Week 4 of our Deep Learning journey, where I started exploring PyTorch for the first time.

## What I Learned

This week, I focused on understanding the basics of PyTorch. I practiced the following:

- What tensors are and how to create them
- Performing operations like addition, subtraction, and reshaping
- Converting tensors to NumPy arrays and vice versa
- Using GPU (CUDA) with tensors
- Writing and running code in Google Colab

I didn’t just copy the code — I took time to understand each line and practiced it on paper first before typing and testing it myself.

## Tools I Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

## About Me

My name is **Haddiqa Ibrahim**, and I’m currently a 2nd semester student of BS Data Science at Islamia University Bahawalpur. This is my first hands-on experience with PyTorch and Deep Learning.
